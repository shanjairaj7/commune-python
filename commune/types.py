"""Typed request/response contracts for the Commune Python SDK.

This module defines the data models returned by all SDK methods. When you
call client.inboxes.create(), client.threads.list(), etc., you get instances
of these classes back — not raw dicts.

Key classes for agent developers:
    Inbox         — a dedicated email address for your agent
    Thread        — a conversation (group of related messages)
    Message       — a single email in a thread
    SendMessageResult — confirmation that your send() succeeded
    AttachmentUpload  — the ID to pass after uploading a file
